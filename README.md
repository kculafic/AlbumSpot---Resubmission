# albumThing

albumThing is the first web application I built, which I submitted as my first quarter project during Galvanize Web Development Immersive (September 2016). This project was built in four days.

albumThing is visual discography interface, that allows you to search for any musical artist. Searches return album releases and artwork (courtesy of the LastFM API) with audio samples based on the first track from each album (courtesy of Spotify's API). There is also a 'Shop' button, which links you to the Discogs record marketplace, where you can see physical copies of albums for sale (based on your artist search parameters).

Technologies used: JS/HTML/CSS, Materialize, Ajax, jQuery and APIs (LastFM and Spotify).
